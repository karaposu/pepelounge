### **Project Description: PepeCoin Lounge App**

**Overview:**
The PepeCoin Lounge is a unique and exclusive community platform designed for PepeCoin enthusiasts. It leverages blockchain technology to create chat groups based on users' PepeCoin holdings, fostering interaction and networking among holders with similar investment levels. By combining blockchain validation with community-driven engagement, the app provides a secure and personalized social experience for the PepeCoin community.

**Key Features:**

1. **Blockchain-Integrated Wallet Verification:**
   - Users validate ownership of their wallets by sending a unique, small amount of PepeCoin to the platform’s wallet.
   - Blockchain data is used to verify the wallet's ownership and holdings securely.

2. **Automated Group Matching:**
   - Users are automatically categorized into exclusive groups (e.g., 10M Holders, 50M Holders) based on their wallet’s holdings.
   - Each group has its dedicated chat lounge for like-minded investors to interact.

3. **Secure and Private Chat Rooms:**
   - Group chats are accessible only to users within the same holding tier.
   - Chat rooms are designed to promote networking, discussions, and collaboration within the PepeCoin ecosystem.

4. **Dynamic Updates:**
   - Periodic revalidation ensures users remain in appropriate groups as their holdings change.
   - Users are notified if they qualify for higher-tier groups.

5. **Community Features:**
   - Exclusive badges or rewards for users based on holding milestones.
   - Leaderboards showcasing top PepeCoin holders (optional, for users who wish to display their rankings).

6. **User-Friendly Interface:**
   - Intuitive design for seamless wallet integration and onboarding.
   - Easy navigation to switch between chat groups or engage with the broader PepeCoin community.

**Target Audience:**
PepeCoin investors and enthusiasts who are looking to connect with others in the community, share insights, and participate in exclusive discussions based on their investment levels.

**Goals:**
- Create a secure and engaging space for PepeCoin holders to connect.
- Promote interaction and collaboration within specific investment tiers.
- Enhance the PepeCoin ecosystem by fostering a sense of exclusivity and community.
